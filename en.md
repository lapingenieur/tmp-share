# Peter Pan : travail en anglais

Peter, you need to grow up : you're almost 16 and you are as childish as a 5 years old child ! You always broke something, just like a kid... You should be more respectful, and not only with us. Be more hard-working at school, and try to be less unconscious ! You also make lots of strange choices : you didn't want to assist to the conference about the world of working last month. Consider you'll nearly  enter it !

Are you affraid by adulthood ? Is that why you want to stay a child ? Or is that you don't want to fight against life's difficulties ?

When you are a child, your main occupation is to play, while when you're an adult, you can try to do some more interresting things like searching to understand the universe around you, people, history and more ! As well, spending all your time playing at several games doesn't do anything for the others, whereas the adults work for the others : a teacher educates his or her students, and this makes more sense than playing to be pirates all the time...

When you'll be an adult, you'll have to be less childish : an adult is an adult ! You will also have don't spend that much time playing, it's a childish activity. You'll need to be more responsible, more serious, and to think of the others.
