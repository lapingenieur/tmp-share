# Peter Pan : travail en anglais

Peter, you need to grow up : you're almost 16 and you are as childish as a 5 years old child ! You always broke something, just like a kid... You should be more respectful, and not only with us. Be more hard-working at school, and try to be less unconscious ! You also make lots of strange choices : you didn't want to assist to the conference about the world of working last month. Consider you'll nearly  enter it !

Are you affraid by adulthood ? Is that why you want to stay a child ? Or is that you don't want to fight against life's difficulties ?
